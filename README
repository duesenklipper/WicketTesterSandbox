This project tries to replace WicketTester with a better approach. The biggest problem with WicketTester is that most of the code tries to literally hack the request to emulate browser functions such as clicking a link or submitting a form. Even worse, there are a lot of hacks to emulate the same functionality when executed via AJAX.

By using env-js we can completely elimiate all these hacks and simplify WicketTester by delegating all the client-side emulation hacks to env-js where the actual code would be executed. WicketTester would then become a simple bridge between the user's code and the env-js runtime.

The current problem is that env-js is incomplete in some places and buggy in others. It does not yet properly support XHR which is a blocker for this project.

If you wish to play with this you have to use my env-js clone and run RhinoTest unit test.
